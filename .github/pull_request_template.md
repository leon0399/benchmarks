## Summary

Implements `<algorithm>/<Name>` benchmark in `<Language>`.

<!-- Brief description of implementation approach -->

## Checklist

Please review [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

- [ ] Studied reference implementations (PHP, C++, or Python)
- [ ] Implementation uses exact same logic as references (no optimizations)
- [ ] File placed in correct directory: `langs/<language>/<algorithm>/<Name>.<ext>`
- [ ] Added to `benchmark.yml` in language directory
- [ ] README.md implementation table updated (❌ → ✅)
- [ ] Tested locally with Docker
- [ ] Commit follows format: `feat(<language>): add <algorithm>/<Name> benchmark`

## Verification

<!-- How did you verify the implementation matches references? -->

Example:
- Compared loop structures with `langs/php/primes/Simple.php`
- Verified same array operations as C++ reference
- Tested output matches expected results

## Notes

<!-- Any additional context or issues encountered -->
